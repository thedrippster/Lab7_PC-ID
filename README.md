# Lab7_PC-ID

In this lab, we created a program that will be used in the datapath for a processor. It contains a program counter, an adder, a ROM file, and an instruction decoder. Int the top level design, all of these parts are connected. The program counter outputs to the adder and the rom file, the rom file reads and outputs to the decoder, and the decoder separates the instructions into the register destination address, register source addresses 1 and 2, and the immediate value.
